Alhamdulillah ala kulli hal, after about [a year](https://firstcommit.netlify.app/?repo=iqfareez/iium_schedule) of (sporadic) development, I'm proud to announce the first stable release of IIUM Schedule app!

The inspiration of IIUM Schedule app comes when I'm thinking is there a way to **auto-generate** my class schedule based on 
the course confirmation slip (CRS) from I'maalum. Then, I stumbled upon [SemiAutomatic Schedule Maker](https://iiumschedule.asdacap.com/schedulemaker/)
by asdacap. It's a great tool, and I've been using it for every semester.

However, in my opinion, the **more mainstream** schedule maker among student is from [ClassUp](https://classup.plokia.com/). 
ClassUp allow students to generate beautiful schedule and allow many customizations. Initially I've been if ClassUp 
has any API to generate schedule. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any. So, here when I taught of combining both of the 
app concepts into one app; **auto-generate beautiful schedule from i-ma'alum**.

Like my other app, I begin by creating a Flutter project and start developing the UI and basic functionalities. Sometimes the
development stalled due to time constraints, but I tried to keep the development slow and steady. I would like 
to thank [PlashSpeed-Aiman](https://github.com/PlashSpeed-Aiman) for his insights and contributions.

All in all, **_reaching stable is a milestone, not an end state_**. IIUM Schedule will continue to improve and evolve. 
All I need is your **support and contribution** to make it better. I'd love to hear your [feedback](feedback) & suggestions.
For someone who can code, this project is waiting for your awesome [pull request](https://makeapullrequest.com/). A contribution guideline
will be documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/iqfareez/iium_schedule/wiki).
